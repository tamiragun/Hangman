# Hangman

This is a React app that simulates the game "Hangman".

## How to install hangman

- To play this game, clone the repository to your local computer.
- Navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
- Inside the repository, start a terminal window.
- Type `npm install` and wait for the process to run.
- If you don't have npm installed, you can get it here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Now type `npm start` and wait for your browser to open a new window.
  You should now be able to play Hangman!

## How to play Hangman

When you click start, the computer will pick a random word and display the
number of letters it contains. Your job is to guess which letters the word
contains, until you can guess the entire word. You do this by entering a
letter in the field below the image, and clicking 'Guess'. If the secret
word contains your letter, it will show up in the corresponding place,
allowing you to better guess the remaining letters. However if the secret
word does not contain your letter, then the drawing of a hanging man is
progressed with one step. You win if you guess all letters in the word
correctly, and you lose if your incorrect guesses lead to the full man being
hung. Press start to play!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
